// euler was simple but it only looks at the derivative at the START of the step
// which is a problem because the derivative is changing the whole time during the step

// rk4 fixes this by taking the derivative at FOUR different points within the step
// and then doing a weighted average of all four samples
// and average all those together

// the four samples are called k1 k2 k3 k4 
// k1 = derivative at the very start of the step, using current state
// k2 = derivative at the midpoint, but we used k1 to estimate where midpoint is
// k3 = derivative at the midpoint AGAIN but this time we use k2 to estimate it 
// k4 = derivative at the end of the step, using k3 to estimate where the end is

// then the final answer weights them as: (k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4) / 6
// the middle samples (k2 and k3) get double weight because theyre more representative
// of whats happening in the MIDDLE of the interval which matters more than just the endpoints
